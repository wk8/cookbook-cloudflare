{"name":"cloudflare","description":"Registers your server with Cloudflare's DNS service","long_description":"Description\n===========\n\nThis Chef! cookbook defines one LWRP that you can easily use in your own cookbook to create and delete Cloudflare DNS records and manage your threat control services.\n\nIt is built on top of B4k3r's Ruby wrapper for the Cloudflare API. (https://github.com/B4k3r/cloudflare)\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nRequires Chef-client version 11.x or later.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nTo be able to use the `clouflare_dns_record` resource, you must define two nodes attributes: `['cloudflare']['credentials']['email']` and `['cloudflare']['credentials']['api_key']`.\n\nI strongly recommend storing your Cloudflare credentials in an encrypted data bag, and then decrypting them in your own cookbook. \n\nThere also are a number of optional node attributes:\n\n* `['cloudflare']['debug']`: used to defined other default attributes (see below - defaults to `false`); basically, you might want to turn that to true when setting up your cookbook, but **be sure to turn that back to `false` when running this cookbook on your actual servers to avoid hitting Cloudflare's API thresholds**\n* `['cloudflare']['check_credentials']`: whether to check your Cloudflare credentials before attempting any API call (defaults to `node['cloudflare']['debug']`)\n* `['cloudflare']['check_zone']`: whether to check if the specified DNS zone(s) exist(s) on your Cloudflare account before trying to add or delete records (defaults to `node['cloudflare']['debug']`)\n* `['cloudflare']['check_with_DNS']`: whether to try checking your records' existence against a DNS server rather than querying the Cloudflare API (will still query the Cloudflare API if the DNS server does not return what's expected - defaults to `true`)\n* `['cloudflare']['DNS_server']`: if you use the `check_with_DNS` option, that is the DNS server that will be queried (defaults to `ns.cloudflare.com`, which is Cloudflare's main public DNS server)\n\nThose attributes come in especially handy if you have a number of servers and get throttled by Cloudflare's API limits.\n\nA couple of threat-control-related attributes are explained in the \"`threat_control` Resource\" section below.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use the `clouflare_dns_record` resource in your own cookbook, simply tell Chef! that your cookbook depends on this one, by adding `depends 'cloudflare'` in your `metadata.rb` file.\n\n`clouflare_dns_record` Resource\n-------------------------------\n\nThis resource defines the following attributes (they're all `String`s unless otherwise specified):\n\n* `name` (required): the name of the Chef! resource. It is also the name of the DNS record, unless the `record_name` attribute is set\n* `record_name` (optional): as said above, you can set that attribute to override the name of the DNS record (useful for registering several records with the same name - e.g. in different zones - during the same Chef! run)\n* `zone` (required): the zone of the DNS record\n* `content` (optional - defaults to `node.ipaddress`): the content of the DNS record\n* `type` (one of `'A'` or `'CNAME'` - defaults to `'A'`): the type of the DNS record. Please let me know if you'd like other record types supported\n* `ttl` (must be a `Fixnum` - defaults to `1`, which, according to Cloudflare's doc, means 'automatic'): the ttl of the DNS record\n* `shared_A_record` (boolean - optional, defaults to `false`): set that to `true` if you want to have several A records with the same name (aka DNS load balancing). Also works for deleting a single A record when several share the same name. Disclaimer: IMHO, that's [pretty bad practice](http://bitplex.me/2008/09/why-round-robin-dns-is-bad.html). This attribute is totally ignored for CNAME records.\n\nFor instance, the following code in your cookbook's recipe would create an `A` DNS record `server_name.example.com` pointing to `1.2.3.4` with an automatic TTL:\n\n    cloudflare_dns_record 'server_name' do\n        zone 'example.com'\n        content '1.2.3.4'\n    end\n\nThe `clouflare_dns_record` resource defines two different actions: `:create` and `:delete` (pretty self-explanatory); `:create` is the default one.\n\nAnother example:\n\n    cloudflare_dns_record 'resource_name' do\n        zone 'example.com'\n        record_name 'server_name'\n        action :delete\n    end\n\nwould delete the `server_name.example.com` record from your Cloudflare account.\n\n`threat_control` Resource\n-------------------------\nCloudFlare's threat control can be used to whitelist or blacklist IPs hitting your domains going through their network.\ncf. [CloudFlare FAQ - How do I block or trust visitors in Threat Control?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200171266-How-do-I-block-or-trust-visitors-in-Threat-Control-)\n\nAttribute:\n\n* `ip` (optional): the IP you want to white/blacklist (defaults to `node.ipaddress`)\n\nActions: `:whitelist`, `:blacklist`, `:remove_ip`\nShould be self-explanatory, the latter one being used to remove a white/blacklisted IP from their respective list.\nNote that the default action is `:nothing`!\n\nExamples:\n\n    cloudflare_threat_control 'whitelist_current_server' do\n      action :whitelist\n    end\n\n    cloudflare_threat_control 'shall_we_trust_this?' do\n      ip '208.73.210.203'\n      action :blacklist\n    end\n\nA word on how this LWRP works: we don't want to have Chef hit Cloudflare's API every time it runs, for Cloudflare's API usage thresholds are pretty low. The thing is, unlike DNS records (for which we can query a DNS server instead of the API), there's no way to double-check the current status without making API calls.\nTo get around this, this LWRP caches the current status (and trusts that the cached information is valid) for a while, which is reasonable if your Chef recipe is the only way this should ever be modified in your setup. The cache's validity is controlled by the `['cloudflare']['threat_control']['cache_duration']` node attribute, which defaults to 1 day. Note this attribute expects this duration in days, but does accept floats (so you can set it to `1.0 / 24.0` to reduce it to one hour).\n\nIf you happen to have few enough servers that you don't care about Cloudflare's API usage thresholds, or if you really want your recipe to make calls to the API at every run, you can set the `['cloudflare']['threat_control']['disable_cache']` node attribute to `true` (defaults to `false`).\n\nA caveat worth noting with this resource is that [Cloudflare's API](https://www.cloudflare.com/docs/client-api.html) as of today (08/18/14) offers no way to check the current status of a given IP w.r.t threat control settings, nor does it give any information when making a call to set an IP's status regarding its previous status. As a result, _this resource will be marked as updated whenever an API call is made, even if the status wasn't actually changed_.\n\nNote that you can't use the cache with Chef solo, as there's nowhere to save the information to. [Chef-zero](https://github.com/opscode/chef-zero) will do nicely though if you don't have a Chef server around.\n\nExample recipe\n==============\n\nYou can have a look at the `cloudflare::example` recipe for examples on how to use the DNS-related LWRPs.\n\nYou can also test my cookbook with Vagrant (see the 'Vagrant' section below).\n\nVagrant\n=======\n\nYou can test this cookbook locally, provided you have a bunch of free software installed, namely [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads), [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), and a couple of Vagrant plugins: [Vagrant-Berkshelf](https://github.com/berkshelf/vagrant-berkshelf) and [Vagrant-Omnibus](https://github.com/schisamo/vagrant-omnibus).\n\nYou also need to define 3 environment variables to be able to use my Vagrantfile:\n\n* `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL`\n* `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`\n* `CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN`\n\nYou can do so by typing e.g. `export CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL='me@example.com'` and so on in your shell.\n\nBe aware that the example recipe will then proceed to create a few DNS records on that DNS zone with your credentials, so use with caution! That being said, all said records will start with 'cl-cb-test-' so they have little chance of clonflicting with exisiting records on your account.\nAlso, it does white-black list a couple of private IP addresses.\n\nYou can also easily clean up the test records created that way by running `CLOUDFLARE_CLEANUP=1 vagrant provision`.\n\nThen playing with this cookbook should be as easy as running `bundle install --path vendor/bundle && vagrant up`!\n\nNote that if you want to test/do stuff on the caching mechanism for the threat control LWRP, you'll need to use Chef-zero. For now this project uses the [Vagrant-Chef-Zero](https://github.com/andrewgross/vagrant-chef-zero) plugin, but we'll soon migrate to Test Kitchen.\nTo use the Chef-Zero plugin, simply install it, the Vagrantfile will pick it up automatically.\n\nContributing & Feedback\n=======================\n\nAs always, I appreciate bug reports, suggestions, pull requests, feedback...\nFeel free to reach me at <wk8.github@gmail.com>\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n* 0.1.7 (Aug 18, 2014)\n    * Added the `threat_control` LWRP allowing to whitelist or blacklist IPs on CloudFlare (see https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200171266-How-do-I-block-or-trust-visitors-in-Threat-Control-)\n\n* 0.1.6 (Jul 9, 2014)\n    * Added the `shared_A_record` attribute to the LWRP to make it possible to have several A records with the same name (aka DNS load balancing)\n    * Properly updating LWRP states when an action has been performed\n    * More complete example recipes (should integrate Test Kitchen soon)\n\n* 0.1.5 (Jul 8, 2014)\n    * Included Vagrant & Berkshelf for easier development\n\n* 0.1.4 (Apr 23, 2014)\n    * Fixed a bug when there were too many records to be loaded in one call from CloudFlare\n    * Made it more compliant with ill-formatted record names\n\n* 0.1.3 (Mar 21, 2014)\n    * Upgraded the Cloudflare gem to the newest version 2.0.1\n\n* 0.1.2 (Nov 14, 2013)\n    * Changed default DNS server from Google's to Cloudflare's to avoid new records from not resolving for a long time on Google's server\n\n* 0.1.1 (Nov 6, 2013)\n    * Some small bug fixes\n    * Reduced the number of calls to the Cloudflare API with the vanilla options\n    * Added a number of options to reduce the number of calls to the Cloudflare API further, most notably made it possible to query a DNS server to check records' existence\n\n* 0.1.0 (Oct 3, 2013)\n    * Initial release\n\nContributors\n============\n\n* [Adrien Siebert](https://github.com/asiebert)\n","maintainer":"Jean Rouge","maintainer_email":"jer329@cornell.edu","license":"unlicense","platforms":{},"dependencies":{},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"0.1.7"}
