  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nThis Chef! cookbook defines one LWRP that you can easily use in your own cookbook to create and delete Cloudflare DNS records.\n\nIt is built on top of B4k3r's Ruby wrapper for the Cloudflare API. (https://github.com/B4k3r/cloudflare)\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nRequires Chef-client version 11.x or later.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nTo be able to use the `clouflare_dns_record` resource, you must define two nodes attributes: `['cloudflare']['credentials']['email']` and `['cloudflare']['credentials']['api_key']`.\n\nI strongly recommend storing your Cloudflare credentials in an encrypted data bag, and then decrypting them in your own cookbook. \n\nThere also are a number of optional node attributes:\n\n* `['cloudflare']['check_credentials']`: whether to check your Cloudflare credentials before attempting any API call (defaults to `true`)\n* `['cloudflare']['check_zone']`: whether to check if the specified DNS zone(s) exist(s) on your Cloudflare account before trying to add or delete records (defaults to `true`)\n* `['cloudflare']['check_with_DNS']`: whether to try checking your records' existence against a DNS server rather than querying the Cloudflare API (will still query the Cloudflare API if the DNS server does not return what's expected - defaults to `false`)\n* `['cloudflare']['DNS_server']`: if you use the `check_with_DNS` option, that is the DNS server that will be queried (defaults to `ns.cloudflare.com`, which is Cloudflare's main public DNS server)\n\nThose attributes come in especially handy if you have a number of servers and get throttled by Cloudflare's API limits.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTo use the `clouflare_dns_record` resource in your own cookbook, simply tell Chef! that your cookbook depends on this one, by adding `depends 'cloudflare'` in your `metadata.rb` file.\n\n`clouflare_dns_record` Resource\n-------------------------------\n\nThis resource defines the following attributes (they're all `String`s unless otherwise specified):\n\n* `name` (required): the name of the Chef! resource. It is also the name of the DNS record, unless the `record_name` attribute is set\n* `record_name` (optional): as said above, you can set that attribute to override the name of the DNS record (useful for registering several records with the same name - e.g. in different zones - during the same Chef! run)\n* `zone` (required): the zone of the DNS record\n* `content` (optional - defaults to `node.ipaddress`): the content of the DNS record\n* `type` (one of `'A'` or `'CNAME'` - defaults to `'A'`): the type of the DNS record. Please let me know if you'd like other record types supported\n* `ttl` (must be a `Fixnum` - defaults to `1`, which, according to Cloudflare doc, means 'automatic'): the ttl of the DNS record\n\nFor instance, the following code in your cookbook's recipe would create an `A` DNS record `server_name.example.com` pointing to `1.2.3.4` with an automatic TTL:\n\n    cloudflare_dns_record 'server_name' do\n        zone 'example.com'\n        content '1.2.3.4'\n    end\n\nThe `clouflare_dns_record` resource defines two different actions: `:create` and `:delete` (pretty self-explanatory); `:create` is the default one.\n\nAnother example:\n\n    cloudflare_dns_record 'resource_name' do\n        zone 'example.com'\n        record_name 'server_name'\n        action :delete\n    end\n\nwould delete the `server_name.example.com` record from your Cloudflare account.\n\nContributing & Feedback\n=======================\n\nAs always, I appreciate bug reports, suggestions, pull requests, feedback...\nFeel free to reach me at <wk8.github@gmail.com>\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n* 0.1.2 (Nov 14, 2013)\n    * Changed default DNS server from Google's to Cloudflare's to avoid new records from not resolving for a long time on Google's server\n\n* 0.1.1 (Nov 6, 2013)\n    * Some small bug fixes\n    * Reduced the number of calls to the Cloudflare API with the vanilla options\n    * Added a number of options to reduce the number of calls to the Cloudflare API further, most notably made it possible to query a DNS server to check records' existence\n\n* 0.1.0 (Oct 3, 2013)\n    * Initial release\n",
